	This is a graph I use to track my progress in web development education. Its seems kind of silly but numerous studies indicate tracking one's progress leads to faster and more consistent achievements. I initialized the dataset with some crude estimations of how many hours I imagine I've invested into pure education of a topic. 'Experience' gained after initializing the dataset is accrued per hour spent studying. Time is tracked manually via <a href="http://www.overcommitted.com/tictoc/">Tictoc</a> application.
